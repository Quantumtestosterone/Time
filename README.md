## 🎯 Vision

Constellation Time Flow represents the future of time management - a sophisticated platform that transforms how individuals and teams allocate their most precious resource: **time**. Built with the Aegis Arc philosophy of **Protection**, **Innovation**, and **Expertise**.
Obviously this readme was made by AI, the point of making this is to create a "Base" for a bigger more unified tool, the point here is to find a reliable way to track your activites across the day and since every developer eventually makes a calender app I figured I would make mine count, I'm making this mainly for myself in order to track my own Time allocation and more importantly
being able to export that Data as Json and pass it trough my MCP server to my AI which enables me to use this data for further use cases. The end goal is to create an EXOCORTEX based on Neurohacking methodes which I may share as the development progresses. If youre a developer that came across this, then this will look like a vibecoded pile of shit and I'll admit that it is right now, 
the backend is missing the ML logic is missing to predict how you are actually spending your time and will likely the next day, Optimisation suggestions are mission, no agent is integrated, the export to json is wonky and I am frankly embarassed to even share this here but I got to start somewhere. Design looks shit, i know.
